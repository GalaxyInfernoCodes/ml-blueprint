# ML Blueprint

A starter template for machine learning projects as part of my newsletter series: https://www.sarahglasmacher.com/ml-repo-structure-challenge/

## Features

- Project structure for ML workflows using a Python package for easier deployment later on
- Example scripts for data processing, training, and evaluation
- Using Pydantic for safe and verified configuration .yamls 
- Pyproject.toml file for dependency and project management

## Getting Started

For the repository to make it your own, then:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-blueprint.git
    cd ml-blueprint
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

## Example Data
Uses example data from the following Kaggle dataset for demonstration purposes only:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e12/data

To use the repo, add the data yourself in the following structure:
